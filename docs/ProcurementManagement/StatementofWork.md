##  Statement of Work 
### I.	Scope of Work:
As we are developing a static web-site which helps the students at NWMSU to learn Project Management knowledge Areas in a simple way scope of our project is limited. We are not giving any backend functionality to the users. The site will be having lucrative diagrams , Idioms etc so that the hard to remember concepts can be recall easily by visualizing graphical content. 

### II.	Location of Work:

As we are students as of now the location of the work is B.D. Owens Library - Northwest Missouri State University. If our project gets approved we would look forward to take office with more number of resources.
