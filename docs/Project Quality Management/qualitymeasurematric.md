### Test Cases by Requirement
It allows us to implement Most common way to see what features are being tested, and see how many tests we have aligned with a user story or requirement.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>REQ</th>
    <th>TC Name</th>
    <th>Test Result</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>REQ 1</td>
    <td>Hosted Site is working or not</td>
    <td>Pass</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>REQ 2</td>
    <td>New pages added successfully or not</td>
    <td>Failed</td>
  </tr>
  
</table>

### Defects per Requirement (Requirement Defect Density)
Defect density per requirement helps uncover which requirement are more risky than others. For example, the test cases might be fine, but the requirement might be whatâ€™s causing all the problems.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Req name</th>
    <th>Total Number of Defects</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Adding new Pages</td>
    <td>25</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gathering info</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
